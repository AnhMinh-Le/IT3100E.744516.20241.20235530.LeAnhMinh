Question in EX8: If you create a constructor method to build a DVD by title then create a constructor method to build a DVD by category. Does JAVA allow you to do this?
Answer:
Yes, Java enables the creation of multiple constructor methods within a class, each with distinct parameter lists, including those that accept various types or quantities of parameters. This capability is referred to as constructor overloading. Each constructor can carry out different initialization processes depending on the parameters it is given.
